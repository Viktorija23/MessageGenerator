Hello.

For this project, I will build a message generator program.
Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
My project will be a random menu generator.
To make my program truly random, the message that it outputs will be made up of
three different pieces of data. 
I will take what I know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to my liking.
